# CausalInvestData Explainer

## What is this?

CausalInvestData is an R package that provides high-quality, simulated datasets designed for developing, testing, and teaching **causal inference methods** in the context of **institutional investment management**.

## Why use this package?

Institutional finance professionals, data scientists, and researchers often struggle to find relevant datasets for training causal models. This package solves that by offering curated, labeled datasets that simulate:

- Fund performance with treatment interventions
- Portfolio allocation strategies
- Client behavioral outcomes (e.g., churn, satisfaction)
- Macroeconomic time-series shocks

## Who is this for?

- Financial data scientists
- Quant researchers
- Academics teaching causal inference
- Developers testing causal ML pipelines

## Use Cases

- Propensity score matching for investment strategy evaluation
- Causal forest models for treatment heterogeneity
- Impact of advisory services on client churn
- Macroeconomic sensitivity testing
