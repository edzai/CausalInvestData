## 🌍 Natural Experiments in Causal Inference

Natural experiments use **external, unplanned variation** to estimate causal effects when randomization is not possible. Examples include policy changes, eligibility cutoffs, or geographic variation.

---

## 1. 🎯 Simulate a Sharp Cutoff (e.g., policy eligibility at age 60)

```{r}
set.seed(42)
n <- 1000
age <- runif(n, 50, 70)
treatment <- ifelse(age >= 60, 1, 0)
noise <- rnorm(n)
Y <- 3 * treatment + 0.1 * age + noise  # treatment has causal effect of 3

df <- data.frame(age, treatment, Y)
head(df)
```

---

## 2. 📊 Visualize the Discontinuity

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = age, y = Y, color = factor(treatment))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 60, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Sharp Regression Discontinuity at Age 60",
       x = "Age", y = "Outcome", color = "Treatment") +
  theme_minimal()
```

---

## 3. 🧪 Estimate Local Treatment Effect Near Cutoff

```{r}
local_data <- df %>% filter(age >= 58 & age <= 62)
rd_model <- lm(Y ~ treatment + age, data = local_data)
summary(rd_model)
```

---

## 4. ✅ Assumptions of RD Design

- **No manipulation** around the cutoff (check density)
- **Continuity** in covariates and potential outcomes
- **Precise cutoff** for assignment

---

## 5. 📚 Real-World Examples

- 🎓 College access based on test scores
- 💼 Job subsidies based on firm size
- 💊 Treatment access based on age or income cutoffs

---

## ✅ Summary

Natural experiments leverage real-world variation to estimate causal effects. A sharp **regression discontinuity design** mimics randomization near a cutoff and provides credible causal estimates.

For more robust tools, explore the `rdrobust`, `rdd`, or `rdpower` packages.
