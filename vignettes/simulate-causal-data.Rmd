## 🧪 Why Simulate Causal Data?

Simulating data helps us **validate assumptions** and understand the behavior of causal estimators under controlled conditions. It’s also a great tool for teaching.

---

## 1. 🎲 Simulate Covariates

```{r}
set.seed(123)
n <- 1000

X1 <- rnorm(n, mean = 50, sd = 10)       # Age
X2 <- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)                  # Gender (0/1)
X3 <- rnorm(n, mean = 50000, sd = 15000) # Income

covariates <- data.frame(X1, X2, X3)
head(covariates)
```

---

## 2. 🧮 Simulate Treatment Assignment

We use a logistic model for treatment assignment based on covariates:

```{r}
logit <- -3 + 0.05 * X1 + 0.8 * X2 - 0.00002 * X3
prob_treat <- 1 / (1 + exp(-logit))
W <- rbinom(n, 1, prob_treat)
```

---

## 3. ✨ Define Potential Outcomes

```{r}
Y0 <- 0.5 * X1 + 2 * X2 + rnorm(n, 0, 5)
Y1 <- Y0 + 5  # Treatment adds 5 units
```

---

## 4. 📊 Create Observed Outcome

```{r}
Y_obs <- ifelse(W == 1, Y1, Y0)

data <- covariates %>%
  mutate(treatment = W,
         Y0 = Y0,
         Y1 = Y1,
         Y_obs = Y_obs)

head(data)
```

---

## 5. 📏 Estimate True vs. Observed Effects

```{r}
true_ate <- mean(Y1 - Y0)
est_ate <- mean(data$Y_obs[data$treatment == 1]) - mean(data$Y_obs[data$treatment == 0])

cat("True ATE:", round(true_ate, 2), "\n")
cat("Estimated ATE (unadjusted):", round(est_ate, 2), "\n")
```

---

## 6. 📉 Visualize Propensity Score Overlap

```{r}
data$prop_score <- prob_treat

ggplot(data, aes(x = prop_score, fill = factor(treatment)))
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
  labs(title = "Propensity Score Overlap",
       x = "Propensity Score", fill = "Treatment")
  theme_minimal()
```

---

## ✅ Summary

We created:
- Covariates
- Treatment assignment (non-random)
- Two potential outcomes (Y0, Y1)
- Observed outcomes
- ATE comparison

Simulating data helps you test models, teach concepts, and better understand bias and variance in causal analysis.
