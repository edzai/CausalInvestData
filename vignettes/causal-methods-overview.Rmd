## 🧠 What is Causal Inference?

Causal inference is the process of estimating the **effect of an intervention or treatment** on an outcome. Unlike correlation, causal inference requires assumptions about how data was generated.

In this article, we use the `fund_performance` dataset to illustrate common methods.

```{r}
data("fund_performance")
head(fund_performance)
```

## ⚖️ 1. Naive Difference in Means

This method assumes random treatment assignment.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
fund_performance %>%
  group_by(treatment) %>%
  summarise(mean_return = mean(return))
```

---

## 🎯 2. Propensity Score Matching (PSM)

PSM attempts to create a balanced dataset by matching treated and control units on their probability of receiving treatment.

```{r}
psm <- matchit(treatment ~ market_return + alpha + beta, data = fund_performance, method = "nearest")
summary(psm)
```

Check matched data:

```{r}
matched_data <- match.data(psm)
ggplot(matched_data, aes(x = return, fill = factor(treatment)))
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
  labs(title = "Return Distribution After Matching", fill = "Treatment")
  theme_minimal()
```

## 🌲 3. Causal Forests (Optional)

You can also use more advanced estimators like **causal forests** (via the `grf` package). These are not covered here but can estimate heterogeneous treatment effects.
