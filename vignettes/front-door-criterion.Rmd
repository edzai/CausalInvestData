## 🚪 Front-door Criterion in Causal Inference

The **front-door criterion** allows causal identification even when there is an unmeasured confounder between the treatment and outcome — provided we can observe a **mediator** that fully transmits the causal path.

---

## 1. 🎯 Simulate Front-door Data

```{r}
set.seed(42)
n <- 1000

U <- rnorm(n)                # Unobserved confounder
X <- 0.5 * U + rnorm(n)      # Treatment influenced by U
M <- 1.5 * X + rnorm(n)      # Mediator influenced by X
Y <- 2 * M + 0.5 * U + rnorm(n)  # Outcome influenced by M and U

df <- data.frame(X, M, Y)
head(df)
```

---

## 2. ⚠️ Naive Regression is Biased

```{r}
naive_model <- lm(Y ~ X, data = df)
summary(naive_model)
```

---

## 3. 🧠 Estimate Causal Effect Using Front-door Formula

```{r}
model_M_X <- lm(M ~ X, data = df)
model_Y_M <- lm(Y ~ M, data = df)

beta_M_X <- coef(model_M_X)["X"]
beta_Y_M <- coef(model_Y_M)["M"]

frontdoor_effect <- beta_M_X * beta_Y_M
cat("Estimated Front-door Effect:", round(frontdoor_effect, 2))
```

---

## 4. 📈 Visualize Causal Chain

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = X, y = M)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Path A: Treatment to Mediator", x = "Treatment (X)", y = "Mediator (M)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(x = M, y = Y)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Path B: Mediator to Outcome", x = "Mediator (M)", y = "Outcome (Y)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

---

## ✅ Assumptions for Front-door Identification

- All **directed paths** from X to Y go through M
- No unmeasured confounders of X → M and M → Y
- X must have a causal effect on M
