## 🎯 Instrumental Variables with Simulated Data

Instrumental Variables (IV) help identify causal effects when there is unobserved confounding. An instrument affects the treatment but has no direct path to the outcome.

---

## 1. 🧪 Simulate Confounded Data

```{r}
set.seed(123)
n <- 1000

U <- rnorm(n)  # unobserved confounder
Z <- rbinom(n, 1, 0.5)  # instrument
X <- 0.5 * Z + 0.7 * U + rnorm(n)  # treatment, influenced by instrument and confounder
Y <- 2 * X + 1 * U + rnorm(n)      # outcome, influenced by treatment and confounder

data <- data.frame(Y, X, Z, U)
head(data)
```

---

## 2. ⚠️ OLS is Biased Due to Unobserved Confounding

```{r}
ols_model <- lm(Y ~ X, data = data)
summary(ols_model)
```

---

## 3. ✅ Use IV: Estimate via `ivreg`

```{r}
iv_model <- ivreg(Y ~ X | Z, data = data)
summary(iv_model)
```

---

## 4. 📊 Visualize the First Stage (Z → X)

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = factor(Z), y = X))
  geom_boxplot(fill = "skyblue")
  labs(title = "First Stage: Instrument Z Effect on Treatment X", x = "Instrument (Z)", y = "Treatment (X)")
  theme_minimal()
```

---

## 5. ✅ IV Assumptions Recap

- **Relevance**: Z is correlated with X ✔️
- **Exclusion Restriction**: Z does not directly affect Y ❌ (U must not be affected by Z)
- **Independence**: Z is independent of unmeasured confounders (U)

---

## 📌 Summary

| Method | Coefficient on X | Notes |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| OLS    | Likely biased     | Confounded by U |
| IV     | Unbiased if valid | Uses Z to isolate exogenous variation |
